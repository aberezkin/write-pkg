# write-pkg

> Write a `package.json` file

Writes atomically and creates directories for you as needed. Sorts dependencies when writing. Preserves the indentation if the file already exists.

$ npm install write-pkg
```


## Usage

const path = require('path');
const writePackage = require('write-pkg');

(async () => {
	await writePackage({foo: true});

	console.log('done');

	await writePackage(path.join('unicorn', 'package.json'), {foo: true});
	console.log('done');
})();
```
